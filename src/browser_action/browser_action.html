<p>Most commercials these days try to look like regular content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe this is not in the best interest of the user.</p>
<p>People should know when they are shown something because it is of interest to them, and when their attention is being bought.</p>
<p>We don't want to remove paid content alltogether because thats how the bills are payed, and we appreciate the real content.&nbsp;</p>
